## 🚀 **Demo Workflow Details**

### **Step 1: Create Project**
```tsx
- Shows DemoProjectList component
- Demonstrates project structure and metadata
- Includes client information and timeline
- Action: "Create New Project" button
```

### **Step 2: Add Team Members**
```tsx
- Shows DemoTeamMembers component
- Displays different user roles (admin, member)
- Shows team collaboration features
- Action: "Invite Team Members" button
```

### **Step 3: Assign Tasks**
```tsx
- Shows BoardComponent with full drag-and-drop
- Interactive Kanban board with To Do, In Progress, Done
- Real task cards with priorities and assignees
- Action: "Create Tasks" button
```

### **Step 4: Track Issues**
```tsx
- Shows IssueCard component
- Demonstrates issue tracking with priority/status
- Shows assignee and project association
- Action: "Report Issue" button
```

## 💡 **Technical Implementation**

### **Dynamic Loading Strategy**
```tsx
// BoardComponent loaded dynamically to prevent SSR issues
const BoardComponent = dynamic(() => import('@/components/boards/BoardComponent'), {
  ssr: false,
  loading: () => <LoadingSkeleton />
});

// Other components loaded normally (no SSR issues)
import { DemoProjectList } from '@/components/ui/DemoProjectList';
import DemoTeamMembers from '@/components/ui/DemoTeamMembers';
import { IssueCard } from '@/components/issues/IssueCard';
```

### **State Management**
```tsx
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1);
const [completedSteps, setCompletedSteps] = useState<number[]>([]);

// Navigation handlers
const handleNext = () => { /* advance to next step */ };
const handlePrevious = () => { /* go to previous step */ };
const handleStepClick = (stepId) => { /* jump to specific step */ };
const handleStepAction = () => { /* mark step complete and advance */ };
```

### **Responsive Navigation**
```tsx
// Step indicators adapt to screen size
<span className="hidden sm:inline">{step.title}</span>
<span className="sm:hidden">{step.id}</span>
```

## 🎨 **Visual Design Elements**

### **Step Indicators**
- **Icon-based navigation** with meaningful icons for each step
- **Color-coded progress** (blue, green, purple, orange)

### **Content Layout**
- **Centered card design** with consistent padding and shadows
- **Clear typography hierarchy** with titles, subtitles, and descriptions
- **Action buttons** prominently placed for each step
- **Progress indicators** showing current position in workflow

### **Animations & Transitions**
- **Smooth step transitions** when navigating
