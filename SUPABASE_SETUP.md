   - Ensure all functions were created without syntax errors
   - Check the Supabase logs for detailed error messages

### Testing Queries

You can test if everything is set up correctly by running these queries in the SQL editor:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('users', 'teams', 'team_users', 'activities', 'notifications');

-- Check if functions exist  
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name IN ('accept_team_invite', 'create_activity_with_notifications');

-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND rowsecurity = true;
```
